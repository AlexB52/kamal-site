# Container labels

You can set custom labels for your containers

```yaml
labels:
  my-label: "10"
```

The labels can also be applied on a per-role basis:

```yaml
servers:
  web:
    - 192.168.0.1
    - 192.168.0.2
  job:
    hosts:
      - 192.168.0.3
      - 192.168.0.4
    cmd: bin/jobs
    labels:
      my-label: "50"
```

## [Traefik Labels](#traefik-labels)

You can use labels to specialize the default Traefik rules:

```yaml
labels:
  traefik.http.routers.hey-web.rule: Host(`app.hey.com`)
```
Traefik rules are in the "service-role-destination" format. The default role will be `web` if no rule is specified. If the destination is not specified, it is not included. To give an example, the above rule would become "traefik.http.routers.hey-web-staging.rule" if it was for the "staging" destination.

**Note:** The backticks are needed to ensure the rule is passed in correctly and not treated as command substitution by Bash!

This allows you to run multiple applications on the same server sharing the same Traefik instance and port. See [doc.traefik.io](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/routers/#rule) for a full list of available routing rules.

## [Shell expansion](#shell-expansion)

You can use shell expansion to interpolate values from the host machine into labels with the `${}` syntax. Anything within the curly braces will be executed on the host machine and the result will be interpolated into the label.

```yaml
labels:
  host-machine: "${cat /etc/hostname}"
```

**Note:** Any other occurrence of `$` will be escaped to prevent unwanted shell expansion!
