# Environment variables


Environment variables can be set directory in the Kamal configuration or
for loaded from a .env file, for secrets that should not be checked into Git.

## [Reading environment variables from the configuration](#reading-environment-variables-from-the-configuration)

Environment variables can be set directly in the configuration file.

These are passed to the docker run command when deploying.
```yaml
env:
  DATABASE_HOST: mysql-db1
  DATABASE_PORT: 3306
```
## [Using .env file to load required environment variables](#using-.env-file-to-load-required-environment-variables)

Kamal uses dotenv to automatically load environment variables set in the .env file present
in the application root.

This file can be used to set variables like KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD or database passwords.
But for this reason you must ensure that .env files are not checked into Git or included
in your Dockerfile! The format is just key-value like:
```
KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=pw
DB_PASSWORD=secret123
```
See [Envify](/docs/commands/envify/) for how to use generated .env files.

To pass the secrets you should list them under the `secret` key. When you do this the
other variables need to be moved under the `clear` key.

Unlike clear valies, secrets are not passed directly to the container,
Â but are stored in an env file on the host
The file is not updated when deploying, only when running `kamal envify` or `kamal env push`.
```yaml
env:
  clear:
    DB_USER: app
  secret:
    - DB_PASSWORD
```
## [Tags](#tags)

Tags are used to add extra env variables to specific hosts.
See [Servers](../servers) for how to tag hosts.

Tags are only allowed in the top level env configuration (i.e not under a role specific env).

The env variables can be specified with secret and clear values as explained above.
```yaml
env:
  tags:
    <tag1>:
      MYSQL_USER: monitoring
    <tag2>:
      clear:
        MYSQL_USER: readonly
      secret:
        - MYSQL_PASSWORD
```
## [Example configuration](#example-configuration)
```yaml
env:
  clear:
    MYSQL_USER: app
  secret:
    - MYSQL_PASSWORD
  tags:
    monitoring:
      MYSQL_USER: monitoring
    replica:
      clear:
        MYSQL_USER: readonly
      secret:
        - READONLY_PASSWORD
```
